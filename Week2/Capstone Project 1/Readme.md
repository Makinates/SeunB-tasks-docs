Design and Deploy a Microservices-based Application:
In this project, you will design and deploy a microservices-based application using containerization and orchestration technologies. The application could be a simple e-commerce platform, a blogging platform, or any other relevant use case.

Tasks:

Identify and design the microservices architecture (e.g., user authentication, product catalog, order management, payment processing)
Find a fitting sample microservices application that uses a programming language and framework of your choice.You are welcome to use and adapt this demo app for your use:

https://github.com/balogsun/microservices-online-retail-app

Build Docker images for each microservice and push them to a private registry
Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., on a cloud provider or locally using Vagrant VMs,  Kind or Minikube)
Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets) for each microservice
Implement service discovery, load balancing, and inter-service communication using Kubernetes Services and Ingress
Configure persistent storage for stateful services (e.g., databases) using Persistent Volumes
Set up monitoring and logging using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack
Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, testing, and deployments
Apply security best practices (network policies, RBAC, secrets management)
